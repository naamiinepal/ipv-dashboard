        The escalation in social media usage amid the pandemic has gathered
        extensive data for Natural Language Processing tasks, many of which
        solve some of the contemporary issues of the world. An abundance of
        these NLP tasks focuses on widely spoken languages like English.
        Moreover, researchers havenâ€™t exploited the true potential of NLP and
        the available data to extract a solution for prominent issues like the
        COVID-19 epidemic. We, through this project, present a COVID tweets
        analysis platform that allows health decision-makers to view a real-time
        analysis of narratives of tweets, particularly in Nepali and Devanagari
        scripts. Our method enables stakeholders to look into the public
        conversation and trends surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic. We categorize
        the tweets across nine curated (mapped from WHO) topics using a MuRIL
        model to summarize our insights. Experimental results reveal the essence
        of our model as it can classify the tweets with appropriate scores for
        the evaluation metrics. The analysis of the results shows that our model
        can portray the growth in the discussions relating to different phases
        of the epidemic.
